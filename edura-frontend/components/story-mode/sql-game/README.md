## How to Add a New Monster

To add a new SQL concept monster:

1. Add a new monster object to the `SQLMonsters` array in `game-data.ts`
2. Select an appropriate Unsplash image for the new monster
3. Configure the challenge, correct answers, and dialog text
4. Update the total levels count in the progress tracking system

Example monster object:

```typescript
{
  id: 14,
  name: "Query Qraken",
  concept: "Advanced Queries",
  image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-appropriate-image-url",
  greeting: "I am Query Qraken! Master of complex SQL queries!",
  challenge: "Write an advanced query combining multiple concepts!",
  task: "Create a query that uses JOIN, GROUP BY, and HAVING in a single statement",
  hint: "Start with a SELECT statement and build from there...",
  skill: "Advanced Querying",
  defeatMessage: "Impressive! You've mastered advanced SQL queries!",
  challengeType: "query",
  correctQueries: ["SELECT", "JOIN", "GROUP BY", "HAVING"]
}
```

## Game Integration

The SQL Jungle Adventure integrates with Edura's story mode through the `sql-game-integration.ts` file, which:

1. Tracks player progress
2. Awards XP for completing levels
3. Records unlocked skills and concepts
4. Manages completion status
5. Persists progress using localStorage (in a real implementation, this would use a database)
